        <h2>About AES Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
            The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely used encryption method that secures data 
            through a process called symmetric key cryptography. This means that the same key is used for both 
            encrypting and decrypting data.
        </p> <hr> 
        <h3>How AES Works ?</h3>
        <p>
            AES works by taking a block of data (128 bits) and a key (128, 192, or 256 bits) to encrypt or decrypt the data. 
            Here's a simplified overview of the process:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Key Expansion:</strong> The key is expanded into multiple key schedules that are used in each round of encryption.</li>
            <li><strong>Initial Round:</strong> The initial data block undergoes an AddRoundKey step where it is combined with the first key schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Main Rounds:</strong> Depending on the key size, there are 10, 12, or 14 main rounds that include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SubBytes:</strong> Each byte in the block is replaced with another byte using a substitution table.</li>
                    <li><strong>ShiftRows:</strong> The rows of the block are shifted to the left to provide diffusion.</li>
                    <li><strong>MixColumns:</strong> Each column of the block is mixed to further scramble the data.</li>
                    <li><strong>AddRoundKey:</strong> The block is combined with the current round key.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Final Round:</strong> The last round is similar but does not include the MixColumns step.</li>
        </ol>  <hr> 
        <h3>Why Use AES?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> AES is highly secure and is used by governments and organizations worldwide.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> It is efficient in both hardware and software implementations.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> AES supports different key lengths, providing options for various security needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Overall, AES is a powerful tool for keeping data safe and is essential in various applications, 
            including online banking, secure communications, and data storage.

            <p>
                <strong>Secret Key:</strong> This is a special password that you create. 
                It is used to lock (encrypt) and unlock (decrypt) your messages. 
                Think of it like a key to a treasure chest: only those with the correct key can open it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure your key is strong and unique. It should be something that others cannot easily guess, 
                but something you can remember. A good key might be a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
            </p>
            <p>
                Always keep your secret key safe. If someone else gets your key, they can unlock your messages. 
                Similarly, if you lose your key, you wonâ€™t be able to read your encrypted messages anymore!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Text to Encrypt/Decrypt:</strong> Type your message here. After you encrypt it, 
                you can copy the result and use it later to decrypt with the same key.
            </p>
