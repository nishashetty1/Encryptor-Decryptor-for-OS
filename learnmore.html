        <h1>Applications of Encryption Decryption in Operating Systems</h1>
        <p>Encryption and decryption are vital for securing sensitive information in operating systems. They protect data integrity, confidentiality, and ensure that only authorized users can access specific information. Here are some key applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Encrypting files and databases to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> Ensuring data transmitted between users and applications is secure.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Using encryption to verify user identities and protect login credentials.</li>
            <li><strong>File System Security:</strong> Protecting entire file systems from unauthorized access using encryption technologies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance of Encryption in OS</h2>
        <p>Encryption is crucial in operating systems to mitigate risks associated with data breaches, maintain privacy, and comply with regulatory requirements. Without robust encryption mechanisms, sensitive data could be easily compromised.</p>

        <h2>Comparison of Encryption Algorithms</h2>
        <h3>Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Algorithms</h3>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Type</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                    <th>Examples</th>
                    <th>Use Cases</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Symmetric</td>
                    <td>Same key is used for encryption and decryption.</td>
                    <td>AES, DES, RC4</td>
                    <td>File encryption, database encryption.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Asymmetric</td>
                    <td>Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption.</td>
                    <td>RSA, ECC, DSA</td>
                    <td>Secure data transmission, digital signatures.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Which Algorithms are Best?</h2>
        <p>Currently, AES is widely regarded as one of the best symmetric algorithms due to its efficiency and security level. For asymmetric encryption, RSA and ECC are popular choices due to their strong security properties.</p>
